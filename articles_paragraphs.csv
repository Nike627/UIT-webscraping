317,INTRODUCTION,Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
318,"Democracy,often touted as the best form of government, promises a system of governance in which power is vested in the people. It is heralded for its promotion of equality, freedom and participation, where leaders are chosen through free and fair elections. For Nigeria, the journey toward democratic governance has been tumultuous. After decades of military rule, Nigeria transitioned to civilian governance in 1999, ushering in the Fourth Republic. This return to democracy raised hopes for the country’s political stability, economic growth, and social development. However, despite over two decades of democratic rule, many Nigerians still question whether democracy has translated into good governance. This article critically examines the extent to which democracy has led to good governance in Nigeria, analyzing both its successes and failures in addressing the country’s myriad challenges.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
319,Concept of democracy,Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
320,"The idea of democracy, or government by the people, is very old, dating back to ancient Greece. The word itself comes from the Greek words: demos, meaning “the people”, and kratos, meaning “authority”. Macionis (2005), simply defines democracy as “a type of political system that gives to the people as a whole”. Abraham Lincoln, one time president of United States gave a classic definition of democracy as the government of the people, by the people and for the people. This definition of democracy has remained popular to date. This is because it captures the real essence of the practice of democracy as a kind of government that has popular power in which the people are free, happy, duly represented and people decide what happens through their representatives.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
321,"In a democratic state, authority is rooted in the consent of the people, that is, in the belief that people have the right to run or at least to choose their government. Democracies impose clear, legally established limits to what elected officials can do. All participants in the system must obey the rules regarding such principles as open, free and fair elections, one person, one vote, and acceptance of majority decisions while respecting a minority’s right to dissent. Calhoun et al (1997), describe democracy as a system in which “the law guarantees extensive civil liberties, including the freedom to associate with whomever one chooses, freedom of speech and the press, and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure”. A democracy does not claim exclusive, unquestioning loyalty from its people; in fact, if those in power overstep their authority, the people have a right, even a duty, to vote them out of office or impeach them through their representatives. Democracy is increasingly getting attention globally and with globalization it is not losing momentum in popularity. However, democracy in Nigeria is relatively young with a lot of challenges facing its survival and growth. (See: Okoroafor, Ejike .C.

322,Democracy in Nigeria: A historical overview,Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
323,"Nigeria is presently under democratic rule which came on board on May 29, 1999, about a decade ago. Ordinarily speaking, democracy should lay the foundation for good governance to strive in any nation. But neither democracy nor good governance can be said to be on strong grounds in Nigeria today.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
324,"The history of Nigeria’s political system has been marred by instability. Since its independence in 1960, the country has oscillated between civilian and military rule. Military regimes were marked by authoritarian control, corruption, and human rights violations, while civilian governments, though democratic in structure, struggled with inefficiency, widespread corruption, and poor governance.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
325,"In 1999, Nigeria made a historic transition from military rule to a civilian government with the election of Olusegun Obasanjo as president. This period marked the beginning of the Fourth Republic, and for the first time in the country’s history, power was peacefully transferred from one civilian administration to another. This peaceful transition raised hopes that democracy would foster good governance in Nigeria.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
326,"Despite the formal structures of democracy being in place, such as regular elections, freedom of speech, and civil liberties, the country has continued to face significant challenges. These include corruption, inadequate infrastructure, insecurity, poverty, and social inequality. Thus, the fundamental question arises: Has democracy truly led to good governance for Nigerians?",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
327,Democracy and the promise of good governance,Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
328,"The essence of good governance lies in the principles of accountability, transparency, responsiveness, inclusiveness, and the rule of law. For democracy to lead to good governance, it must ensure that these principles are realized. In the Nigerian context, there have been notable improvements in some areas, but there have also been persistent problems that undermine the potential of democracy to deliver good governance.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
329,1.Accountability and Transparency,Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
330,"Accountability is where an individual or organization is responsible for their actions and decisions. Cambridge Dictionary describes accountability as “the fact of being responsible for what you do and able to explain it when asked”. “The Macmillan Dictionary defines accountability as “the fact of being responsible for what you do and for the results of your actions.” In essence, accountability involves being answerable for one’s actions and ensuring that there is transparency and responsibility in fulfilling duties or obligations.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
331,"One of the primary tenets of democracy is accountability, where elected officials are answerable to the electorate for their actions. In theory, democracy should allow citizens to hold their leaders accountable through elections and other democratic processes such as civil society activism and the media. In Nigeria, elections have been held regularly, and power has been transferred peacefully between governments.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
332,"However, the reality is that electoral processes are often marred by irregularities, fraud, and manipulation. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), tasked with overseeing elections, has been criticized for not adequately addressing voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and vote buying, which have eroded public trust in the electoral system. (See. Olusola, S. (2018). “Electoral Integrity and Governance in Nigeria.” African Political Review, 24(2), 33-46).",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
333,"There is a broad agreement that “transparency” is closely tied to the right to know and the public’s access to information. The Cambridge Online Dictionary defines transparency as “the quality of being easy to see through,” “the practice of being open and without secrets,” and “a situation where business and financial activities are conducted openly, ensuring fairness and honesty.” Similarly, the Macmillan Online Dictionary describes it as “the state of being clear enough to see through” and “a straightforward approach that allows others to understand exactly what is being done.” Transparency is a key measure of governance effectiveness and impact, emphasizing openness, honesty, and clarity. “Good governance” encompasses several key attributes: it is participatory, consensus-driven, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective, efficient, equitable, inclusive, and adheres to the rule of law. It ensures the minimization of corruption, considers minority views, and ensures that the voices of society’s most vulnerable are heard in the decision-making process.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
334,"There are two types of transparency. The first is proactive transparency, which involves publishing information of public importance before the public demands it. This approach is based on the belief that all information of public significance belongs to the public and is only held by governmental bodies. It asserts the public’s general right to know, and proactive transparency serves as a mechanism for exercising that right.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
335,"This concept is supported by public administration theorists and international organizations, such as the World Bank. The second type is reactive transparency, which also concerns the public’s right to know, but is carried out in response to popular demand. The goal of achieving full transparency stems from the belief that democracy is rule by the people and that elected representatives are temporary agents who are accountable to the citizens.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
336,"Defined this way, reactive transparency requires public authorities to ensure that citizens are given equal access to information as decision-makers and to share information with the public at the same time as it is shared within the administration. For public administration to respond efficiently and professionally to citizens’ needs and provide quality public services according to the principles of “good governance,” it is crucial to increase transparency and improve ethical standards. A government that is open and accessible is more likely to be transparent. This realization has led to a global movement for more openness in government operations. Michael Johnston defines transparency as the “capacity of outsiders to obtain valid and timely information about the activities of government or private organizations.” He further notes that the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act in the United States in 1966, which provided limited guarantees of citizen access to government information, was a milestone in transparency.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
337,"This model has been adopted in other countries. Democratic and market reforms, along with the growing anti-corruption movement, have significantly contributed to the establishment of transparency as a key governance concept. Transparent political processes are viewed as more accountable and democratic, while transparency in the economy facilitates free-market operations. In both contexts, rights to access information and the corresponding obligations of institutions to uphold those rights are considered safeguards against abuses and vital components of good governance.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
338,"Transparency is seen as essential to various political goals, such as combating corruption, ensuring fair election financing, enhancing democracy, strengthening democratic institutions in transitional societies, and reducing international conflicts. Despite significant changes in Nigeria’s federal structure over time, the country still faces challenges related to transparency and accountability. Power in Nigeria is concentrated within the executive branch, led by the President and his Ministers, and party discipline often means minimal legislative opposition to government policies. The lack of transparency and accountability has undermined the legitimacy of the government. In Nigeria, the need to enhance transparency and accountability in intergovernmental relations is especially urgent due to widespread corruption and the lack of adequate checks on the powers of officials.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/has-democracy-led-to-good-governance-for-nigerians-1/
339,"Transparency is closely linked with accountability and other fundamental principles of modern democratic societies, such as open justice, open government, freedom of information, and public consultation.

In addition to the Boko Haram terror group, an estimated 22 armed groups, prominent among which is the fourth most dangerous group in the world, killer herdsmen, are operating within Nigerian territory.

With military operations in all the 36 states of the federation, the Nigerian Army that traditionally is at the frontline of the defence of Nigeria’s territorial integrity against external aggression has, unfortunately, been drawn into internal security operations as the Nigerian Police Force primarily charged with this responsibility appears totally overwhelmed with the current spate of internal insecurity.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/zulum-more-bullets-and-less-prayers/

This pampering programme is called “Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration” (DDR). This concept is usually applied for post-conflict management when both sides in a war agree to lay down their arms amd embrace peace after negotiated settlements. One of the reasons often used to support this sort of project is that some of the terrorists were either conscripted or induced to join on the pains of death. But for me no excuse is good enough to kill a fellow human being who has not hurt or wronged you in any way.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/the-illogic-of-pampering-terrorists/

They are busy attacking our police and army stations, people on the roads, towns and villages and even persons in Displaced peoples’ facilities, schools and other targets that they consider soft. They have remained ruthless and merciless in their offensive against the Nigerian people.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/the-illogic-of-pampering-terrorists/
404,"This approach towards managing serious crime is quite offensive to most Nigerians including crime-and-punishment experts, communities, law enforcement agencies, victims and right thinking people. These terrorists have done a lot to damage the psyche and wellbeing of Nigerians. They collect huge ransom from Nigerians sometimes without releasing the victims. They collect ransom and still kill their captives under the pretext that the ransom was not huge enough. They sometimes kill their victims and also burn down their houses, thus rendering the survivors homeless.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/the-illogic-of-pampering-terrorists/
405,"This DDR approach conflicts with our criminal justice system and rule of law. A few weeks ago the government of Nigeria approved the release of a few thousand Nigerians with minor offences thus saving about two billion naira in feeding fees for those released from prison. That was a goodwill gesture that pleased many Nigerians because there are thousands of Nigerians who have been put behind bars for years for very minor offences. So if the justice system puts behind bars people who steal bananas and plantain, crayfish and corn, goats and chicken, toothpaste and tooth pick why should hardened criminals who kill or maim people be set free under some dubious agenda? It does not matter whether the terrorists were captured or they surrendered. They ought to be tried under our laws and punished appropriately. If they surrendered and confessed their sins the decision makers in the legal system may decide to give them punishment that is a little milder than what the full wrath of the law prescribes for such offenders. But there can be no freedom for terrorists without punishment. Terrorism is a crime and all crimes must be punished for the society to be sane, and for other potential criminals to be discouraged from taking to crime. Punishment is a deterrent to crime. Non-punishment is an incentive to crime. We must not show compassion to crime, because criminals do not show compassion to their victims no matter how vulnerable, no matter the gender, no matter the age. It is not the guns that they hold that kill people; it is they, the people who hold the guns, that kill people. If the assumption on the part of those proposing the DDR formula is that people may do evil things without being evil, they are wrong. No one can do evil things without being evil inside out.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/the-illogic-of-pampering-terrorists/

Yes, terrorism may be caused by poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and religious extremism. Yes, these issues are there in almost every society. The duty of leaders in every society is to ensure that these contributory causes of crime are reduced to the barest minimum. The duty of every citizen is to ensure that they prevent themselves from being involved in crime despite the challenging times in which we find ourselves today. That is why the people who commit crime are fewer than those who don’t. And that is also why those who commit these crimes cannot, must not, be given a hug by those whose responsibility it is to exterminate crime from the society.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/the-illogic-of-pampering-terrorists/
407,"In this DDR programme the question to ask is: “where is justice for the victim?” Every crime has victims; without a victim there would be no crime. And if a crime occurs and the victim gets no justice, that is double jeopardy especially if the criminal is set free. This DDR programme seems to pay much attention to the terrorist and no attention whatsoever to the victim. In Borno State the Governor Professor Zulum has been campaigning for the rehabilitation of the terrorists who have damaged his State almost irreparably. His plan is to reintegrate these terrorists among the people, among their victims. Is that a good decision? I don’t think so. And the victims are protesting anyway. This is a betrayal of the victims. It cannot make for community harmony and stability. It is a blatant and indirect way of encouraging the spread of terrorism. The logic here is that the potential terrorist will think that if he takes to terrorism and he is caught he will be pardoned, not punished. He will be accepted and taken back into the community and he will be embraced by those he punished if they are still alive.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/the-illogic-of-pampering-terrorists/
408,"There might be some unspoken excuses that are quietly being offered by the security agencies for the DDR programme. One of them may be that these terrorists came from various countries, such countries include Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Libya etc. Wherever criminals come from does not matter. Every person living in any country is subject to the laws of that country. If a foreigner violates the law in his country of residence he must carry the can. Punishing a criminal who is a foreigner does not affect the relationship between the country of origin of the criminal and the country of the criminal’s residence.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/the-illogic-of-pampering-terrorists/
409,The other reason some people think the decision makers are in favour of pardoning and rehabilitating the terrorists is that our prisons are already overcrowded. The prisons may be overcrowded but people who commit serious crimes must not be spared. The executive and the judiciary big wigs must work out ways of punishing small time criminals without necessarily throwing them into jail. They can be subjected to manual labour or such other activities that are fair but are seen as punishment for their offences. That way congestion can be severely reduced in our prisons so that congestion does not become an excuse for setting hardened criminals free.,Columns,https://thesun.ng/the-illogic-of-pampering-terrorists/

Wasn’t late Gen. Sani Abacha like that when almost everybody was endorsing him to continue? Today, nothing seems the same in Nigeria anymore. As historians will tell us, without a vision beyond a leader’s own selfish agenda, a leader is paralyzed immediately he gets the power he desperately wanted.

Oloyede has not only proved to be a decent public servant, he has cultivated and won substantial public confidence for the activities of the examination body. JAMB was not always believable. Indeed, it was once a cesspool of graft and shady contracts. Sadly now, for all that Oloyede may have worked to prove, JAMB has relapsed, through one monumental misdeed, into unreliability.

It is well and fine that as a leader, he took responsibility for the wrong done by his organisation. The truth however, is that the nature and import of the sabotage in the 2025 UMTE exceed what tears can wipe away.

What JAMB tried to put some coating on, as “technical error that compromised the integrity of the result from the 2025 UTME in 157 centres nationwide” was deeper than that. The incident bore the mark of a callous hit job that had a target location in mind. It was a premeditated attack that aimed to extend to the realm of education, the malignancy that has destroyed political leadership and hope of genuine progress in Nigeria.

In some exam centres, one of the papers did not have answers for the first ten questions. The candidates were instructed at the examination hall to jump and pass those questions. Yet, after JAMB proceeded to release the results, top government officials and defenders of evil, promptly commenced spins and justification of the anomaly. One line of justification of the large number of failures at the 2025 UMTE was that it showed that the government’s initiatives to tackle exam malpractices are yielding result. Pray, what are the initiatives to tackle exam malpractice and when were they launched?",Columns,https://thesun.ng/selective-glitches-at-jamb/
452,"Prof, Oloyede has not helped himself and JAMB by the hasty manner they set about to mount fresh UMTE last weekend in the South East. The haste smacks of attempt to cover up something.

The All Progressives Congress ( APC), the political party they are scrambling for, is a plague of sorts. Yet, many are struggling to identify with it. This level of banality has not been seen before in Nigerian politics. But it is happening before our very eyes. Many see the aberration as a sign of the times. By that they mean that the Bola Tinubu presidency is a corrupted version of what democracy should be. Therefore, anything that appertains to it must, necessarily, look weird.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/coalitions-defections-and-allied-matters/

484,"If we must say it as it is, we will not hesitate to point out that Tinubu, the product of the APC, will go down in Nigerian history as one president that personified hardship. As president, Tinubu has reduced Nigeria to a fiefdom. His presidency has destroyed the thin fabric that holds Nigeria together. The country is now a doomed and damning effigy of what it is supposed to be. Under Tinubu, the country has lost its soul and its peoples are tediously trudging on. This situation invites revolt. It urges revolution. The president and the party that produced him ought to be called to account. But rather than look in that direction, the people have conveniently shoved aside their degradation. They are not making an issue out of the poisonous order that has reduced them to doomed voyagers. Instead, they are falling over themselves to identity with the bad and the ugly that the government of the day symbolizes. This is curious through and through.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/coalitions-defections-and-allied-matters/
485,"But analysts have since gone to work. They are working hard to put a finger on why things have gone the way they did. The handiest of their findings lies in the trenchant, if not fatalistic, attitude of the people of northern Nigeria to matters of power. This region of the country lives and breathes political power. It does not want power to slip off its hands for any reason. That is why the north, as a geographical and political entity, does not recognize, let alone respect, zoning in Nigeria’s power equation. This fact is as good as settled. Watchers of and players in Nigeria’s political arena know this. They know that the north is always ready and eager to grab presidential power whether or not the zoning arrangement or understanding favours it. They repudiate zoning because they believe that it could keep them unduly out of political power.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/coalitions-defections-and-allied-matters/
486,"It is on record, for instance, that Muhammadu Buhari, who eventually ascended the presidential throne, stood election for the office of president for four consecutive times. When he ran for the presidency in 2003, he aimed at displacing or stopping a southern incumbent, Olusegun Obasanjo, from attaining a second term in office. When the same Buhari contested for the presidency in 2011, he set out to upstage yet another southern president, Goodluck Jonathan, from retaining power. He (Buhari), ventured again in 2015. This time, he succeeded because Jonathan had a cavalier attitude to political power. He allowed himself to be overrun by opposite forces.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/coalitions-defections-and-allied-matters/
487,"The northern disposition to political power contrasts sharply with what obtains in the south. The south does not intrude or seek to displace the power holder any time it is considered to be the turn of the north. For instance, Buhari spent his eight years in office without a challenger of note from the south. The region simply and quietly allowed the north to take its turn.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/coalitions-defections-and-allied-matters/
488,"The north’s ever-ready disposition to the presidency manifested again in 2023 when it was considered the turn of the south to produce the president. This time, Atiku Abubakar stepped forward to grab power not minding the fact that his region had just completed an eight-year tenure under Buhari. He was a top runner for the office and could, possibly, have won. If that had happened, the north would have held power for 16 unbroken years. But that scheme did not work out. Instead, a southern president emerged, somehow. Yet, the northern hunger for power persisted. Now, there is so much buzz about how to displace Tinubu, the southern president, in 2027. That is understandable. Tinubu has disrupted Nigeria to the point of disaster. He therefore needs to be shown the way out so that the country can be rebuilt. But does the north want Tinubu out because of his poor performance in office? Not exactly.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/coalitions-defections-and-allied-matters/
489,"The region’s quest instead is driven by its undying appetite for power. Rather than enter into an alliance that will produce a competent southerner that will replace Tinubu, the north is scheming to use one of its own to abridge the turn of the south in the name of stopping Tinubu. This is where the problem lies.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/coalitions-defections-and-allied-matters/
490,"For many analysts, this northern plot appears to be fueling the spate of defections that we are witnessing in the polity at moment. Having realized that the north wants him out of power not due to poor performance in office but because the region wants to regain political control of the country, Tinubu has since launched a counter offensive. He is playing up regional sentiment. He is impressing it on southerners that the north wants to take what belongs to them. With this sentiment gaining ground, many southerners are being compelled to embrace Tinubu just to ensure that the northern plot does not work. As a matter of fact, those who will campaign for Tinubu’s return are likely to cash in on this northern agenda if the north insists on taking back power. Already, the likes of Nyesom Wike are raising questions about the propriety of a northerner taking over from Tinubu after just one term. That is why he wants the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to make a pronouncement on its zoning plan for 2027. Wike and concerned political players want to know if Atiku Abubakar who has practically seized PDP since 2019 will still feature in the forthcoming presidential election under the same party. If he does, then the belief that the north wants to grab power again after four years of the south will gain more ground. In fact, the suspicion that Atiku is positioning himself for another presidential run is a major reason why the coalition is not working. Many believe that a coalition that is person-centred is a fraud. It will advance not the interest of the country but that of a cabal. This suspicion for an Atiku-driven coalition is a major reason why defectors are trooping towards Tinubu and his party. If those behind the coalition talks must reverse this unusual trend, they must aim at putting forward a strong and credible southern candidate that will slug it out with Tinubu in 2027. In other words, those who want Tinubu dethroned have good reasons to justify their pursuit. But the quest can only be sustained if a southerner is primed and positioned to take over from him.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/coalitions-defections-and-allied-matters/

The country needs a leader who will have the moral badge to cleanse the nation of corruption. Meaning, such a leader must not be corrupt and shall muster the will to deal with the tribe of the corrupt in the country.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/corruption-contagion/
607,"A nation said to lose $18 billion annually to corruption and financial crimes related to procurement alone cannot have a healthy economy. And Nigeria is economically unhealthy. Tear-away inflation, a weakened local currency, growing poverty and unemployment, shuttering companies, decaying infrastructure, inefficient public utilities, high cost of living, growing domestic and external debt. All of this amount to hunger and anger. At the root of these national misfortunes is corruption. It’s the elephant in the room that nobody in leadership talks about. None acts decisively to deal with it.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/corruption-contagion/
608,"Former military leader, General Sani Abacha, was made the face of corruption in Nigeria. And that was because the man died. A sudden death that did not prepare his men, family and acolytes for the implosion that would come rushing like fluvial flood. And soon after his death, tales of Abacha loot started streaming across multiple media platforms, in the barracks, inside Aso Rock, marketplaces and everywhere that is somewhere. You would think that only Abacha ravaged the national till. Other leaders did, military and civilians. Governors stole and are still stealing. Ministers, senators, civil servants, and just about anybody that is somebody in the public service. For all have stolen, are stealing and will yet steal from the public till. It’s the unwritten creed.Oga(the boss) is stealing. His subordinates know thatOgais a crook. They, too, try to help themselves.Ogasees them steal but looks away because he knows that they know he’s not clean.Ogais too tainted to shout, or even enforce the law. So, the party continues. You steal, they steal. And the nation bleeds.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/corruption-contagion/
609,"Let’s make a list of some corruption cases that were never resolved or were frustrated by those who should have enforced the relevant laws and punished the culprits. The Abdulrasheed Maina pension scam; fuel subsidy scam that witnessed a new generation of emergency oil billionaires; the looting of the external reserves by the exiting military bigwigs referenced by Obasanjo in 1999 during his maiden Presidential Media Chat (Obasanjo referred to General Abdulsalami Abubakar and his colleagues as reckless in the manner they stripped the external reserves of billions of dollars); Halliburton scandal; Siemens bribery scam, PTDF dogfight between Obasanjo and his deputy Atiku Abubakar; Willbros scandal; Ajaokuta Steel fraud; missing $20 billion non-remittance by NNPC as alleged by ex-CBN Governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (PWC Forensic Audit of 2015);  CBN heist under Emefiele in cohort with acquiescing President Buhari and his cabal; the Buhari social security disbursement that saw billions of naira shared to imaginary Nigerians in a manner far beyond the speed of a computer. It’s a long list.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/corruption-contagion/
610,"Back to Abacha and the 40 thieves. Truth is, Abacha was never the only looter. Other leaders, governors, military administrators, Generals, Presidents also looted. But it’s the stench of Abacha loot that is stinking up the whole bus. Recoveries were made. A good $5 billion dollars was said to have been recovered and repatriated from different countries where Nigerian kleptomaniacs usually hide their looted cash. But what happened to the money?",Columns,https://thesun.ng/corruption-contagion/
611,"It took a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja in 2023 to order the Federal Government to disclose the details of the $5 billion loot recovered from Abacha. Why should that be? For about 25 years when the loot repatriation broke, no government has given an account on how the loot was being spent. None. News of repatriation was always elaborately reported but expenditure of the repatriated funds was always top secret. That is the behaviour of a crook. The real reason armed robbers always run into a dead end after a successful operation is their disagreement over sharing formula. The leadership of the robbery gang panders to a criminal proclivity of wrapping the actual looted money in secrecy to the anger of other gang members. This lack of transparency among thieves brews trouble that often burst their bubble and exposes them to security authorities.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/corruption-contagion/
612,"On the Abacha loot, successive Nigerian governments have behaved like armed robbers. They have no reason to keep a lid, any lid, over the money and how it was spent. This has given room, justifiably so, to Nigerians and international bodies to allege that the ‘famous’ Abacha loot has been re-looted. It is certainly not a good report, neither a good testimonial on the character of Nigerian governments, from Obasanjo to Buhari. The incumbent President Tinubu government must summon the courage to open the books once again. All the repatriated funds were wired through banks from Switzerland, United Kingdom, Jersey (British Island), United States, and Liechtenstein. They are not hidden. What is hidden is how the past Nigerian governments spent the money. Any claim that the money or any part of it was shared to the poor is a fraud.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/corruption-contagion/
613,"Now is the time for President Tinubu to open the books for public scrutiny in the spirit of democracy. The pillars of democracy are the rule of law, accountability, openness, and respect for citizens’ rights. Tinubu should play the hero here. Tell Nigerians how your predecessors spent Abacha loot. It is their right to know. This matter should not be swept away in the cloud ofesprit de corps. It is a matter of international concern. It is one of the reasons the Green passport of Nigerian travellers is no longer respected. The opacity of successive Nigerian governments and the criminal silence over matters of corruption are key reasons every Nigerian is treated as a suspect even among notoriously crime-infested nations. Tinubu must raise the bar and end this contagion of corruption.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/corruption-contagion/

638,"Acurse is an affliction of long continuance. There is no doubt that life is full of ups and downs. Even children of God suffer losses at times. But every suffering is meant to be for a moment, to teach wisdom and lesson to the victim. This is why God said, “weeping may endure for the night, but joy comes in the morning.” Unfortunately, for the South East, their sojourn in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has brought shame, degradation and deprivation to them since 1999.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
639,EKWUEME,Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
640,"In 1998, after the sudden death of General Sani Abacha, General Abdulsalami Abubakar speedily organised a transition to democratic rule to terminate on 29th May, 1999. This required urgent alignment and realignment of political forces to jostle for the elective posts in the country. Chief Alex Ekwueme, former Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, led a group of 34 eminent Nigerians to found the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with an intention to raise the nation to the highest level of moral and intellectual dignity, achieve economic and social reconstruction, confront and remedy the social decay that existed in the moral, social, and political condition of the country, and consequently build a prosperous and lasting democracy.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
641,"In furtherance of this objective, PDP committed itself to adhere to the policy ofrotation and zoning of party and public elective offices in pursuance of the principles of equity, fairness, and justice. Alex Ekwueme was from the South, and the power having resided in the North for a long time, he joined the other progressives in lobbying that the power should shift to the South. Being a former Vice President and the Chairman of the G-34 who founded the PDP, it was a natural choice for him to be elected as the presidential candidate of the party.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
642,"This was not to be, as he was reminded that the “owners” of Nigeria had made a choice of President Olusegun Obasanjo, whom they picked from Abacha’s prison, to make him President, to assuage the restiveness of the people of South West for the cancellation of June 12, 1993 presidential election, won by Moshood K.O. Abiola, from the South-West.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
643,"The “owners” of Nigeria obviously neglected that Alex Ekwueme came from the South-East who were promised rehabilitation, reconstruction, and reconciliation since 1970 after their lives and property were unjustly destroyed in a senseless civil war that was fought in the South-East. A Head of State from the South-East was killed in a coup and his death has not been compensated till date and the “owners” of Nigeria believed it was better to compensate a latter injustice of coup against June 12 in favour of the South-West than an earlier civil war against the South East.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
644,"The “owners” of Nigeria also rejected the idea that any notable politician from the South can be used to compensate for June 12 since the rotation was between North and South, not among the six geopolitical zones. They insisted on choosing the candidate from South-West to pay for June 12. Indeed, the two candidates for the presidential election of 1999 were from the South-West, Chief Olu Falae, and Olusegun Obasanjo. Alex Ekwueme lost out simply because he was from the South-East, even though democratically, he was the most qualified.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
645,"By 2003, Alex Ekwueme appeared again and reminded PDP that they agreed that every candidate who wins will spend four years in office so that it will rotate around the six geopolitical zones of the country in 24 years, thereby bringing total reconciliation for every part of Nigeria. Again this proposal was rejected. Obasanjo contested again and won, and would have contested for a third time were it not that he lost the executive bill for the amendment of the Constitution to guarantee third term for him.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
646,"During his reign as President, the Senate President was zoned to the South East for eight years. Obasanjo, under PDP, supervised the humiliation of many Senate Presidents from the South-East to the extent that the post was changed five times within eight years of his presidency. When he was denied third term, he chose South-South to produce the Vice-President to President Umaru Yar’Adua, rather than South-East. Goodluck Jonathan, the vice presidential pick became President with the death of Yar’Adua. Jonathan won re-election in 2011 as President. During this period, South-East was downgraded by PDP to the post of Deputy Senate President.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
647,"In all these periods, South-East was absolutely loyal to PDP. It voted for the party across ethnic and religious lines. It voted for South-West (Yoruba Christian), North-West (Fulani Muslim), South-South (Ijaw Christian) in 1999, 2007, and 2011 respectively. In 2015, it still loyally voted for PDP even when some PDP states voted against their own presidential candidate, Goodluck Jonathan. When Buhari won the 2015 presidential election, he singled out the South-East for marginalization saying he received only five percent of votes from them. During Buhari’s second term, South-East was not even found in the first six of the elective posts. South-East continued their downward spiral to political abyss under PDP without any efforts by PDP to stop this political disgrace.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
648,"Buhari was president for eight years, and in 2023 when it was the time for the post of the President to go to the South, it was not debatable that it should go to the South-East in PDP since both the South-West and the South-South had produced presidents. Yet, it was with utmost embarrassment to the South-East that the post was not zoned to the it. Even Atiku Abubakar, who was reputed to be contesting at every presidential election, offered to step aside if the post was zoned to the South-East. Unfortunately, PDP failed, neglected, and refused to zone the post to the South-East.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
649,"At this juncture, the South-East came under the conclusion that the PDP is a curse on it not a blessing. For the first time in the Fourth Republic, South-East voted against the PDP and of course PDP failed. One would have thought that the PDP would learn from this 2023 political statement by the South-East to make amends with the South-East and restore the confidence of its most trusted ally. It’s disheartening that PDP has even taken the insult against the South-East too far. Today, South-East is not even allowed the freedom to elect members of the National Working Committee (NWC) that are zoned to it.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
650,"At the heart of the present controversy is the issue of the National Secretary of the PDP which was zoned to the South-East. The former Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu, embarked on a gubernatorial election to govern Imo State. While he was away, the South-East nominated Sunday Ude-Okoye to take his place and he did. Anyanwu lost at the polls and failed to become Imo State governor. Rather than proceeding with his life into other areas of endeavour, he came back to resume his former office of National Secretary. He didn’t even bother to seek the support of the South-East PDP to come back as National Secretary, he simply bulldozed his way back. Ude-Okoye went to court and won at the two lower courts before the Supreme Court ruled that the courts do not have the jurisdiction to impose leaders on a political party.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
651,"Whenever the Supreme Court declines jurisdiction in any matter, the judgement means that the parties are returned to the status quo before the case was instituted. In this case, the status quo was that Sam Anyanwu left the office of the National Secretary to contest the gubernatorial election and the party decided that to replace him to ensure that the administrative wheel of the party didn’t grind to a halt. The courts simply held that the decision of the party should be respected.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
652,"The South-East has decided that it should be Ude-Okoye and that ought not to even raise any grouse. Yet as at today, three persons are laying claim to the office, simply because, Nyesom Wike, an All Progressives Congress (APC) Minister from the South-South is backing Sam Anyanwu to be the National Secretary to maintain his grip on the party. The latest meeting of the South-East PDP has had enough of the shenanigans of the PDP and issued an ultimatum –accept our candidate Ude-Okoye or risk our departure from the party.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/
653,"It’s important to note that even if South-East leaves PDP today, they are already even late in exiting. If the South-East is not allowed to present a National Secretary of their choice, the party has become a curse that has nothing to offer South-East. As 2027 general election approaches, South-East should be wiser and should cease to align with any party that does not cater for its interest. PDP is gone. It’s looking for who it will take with it while going down to the pit, and certainly the zone that will depart with it will not be South-East, God willing, and will not be any zone in Nigeria for that matter. Naked it came to Nigeria, and naked it will depart.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/pdp-and-political-curse-on-south-east/

656,"Way back, I knew a man who was popular in my area. He was witty, but everybody also knew that his mental faculty was usually off and on. He was not necessarily mad, but seemed to be in-between sanity and insanity. He was our local entertainer while I was growing up. In his psychological imbalance, he could say things that were weighty, truthful and big moral lessons. He always sat at a corner in the village to entertain people,without really knowing he was doing so. On one particular occasion, he said it was better for a man to be poor than to live with a bitter, toxic spouse.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/relating-with-bitter-toxic-husbands/

659,"These men cannot manage spouses who have achieved success and distinguished themselves. The moment a wife attains success, either through a promotion orbusiness boom that runs into six-figures, and therefore makes her financially, socially and economically more relevant with the attendant power that flows such success, a good man would embrace the wife’s success and celebrate it. But a bitter and toxic husband does the opposite. It is difficult for him to live with the woman’s success.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/relating-with-bitter-toxic-husbands/

663,"Regrettably, there are so many men who find it easy to pull a woman down, to sustain their control over them. Such men only see a woman as a piece for sexual pleasure who could be discarded at will. The newly elected Pontiff, Pope Leo XIV, once said: “The truth of the human person, male and female, is not cultural construction, but a divine gift.” But some men do not see their women asdivine gifts given to them from God.

First, Margaret had to stop her banking job to face procreation. By the next time her colleagues saw her, she had descended from a banker to a seamstress while her husband retained his job. Not long after, he lost his job. The sudden loss of his financial power made him bitter and led to his creating a toxic environment in his marriage, to the point that they separated. On the other hand, some men treasure their wives and see them as blessings from God.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/relating-with-bitter-toxic-husbands/
665,"Several years ago, when I visited Lagos for the first time as a young person, I overheard in the middle of the night the noise of a quarrel between a couple, Femi and Bunmi. The man was educated but engaged in business while the wife was an accountant. Their flat was above that of my relatives, who lived on the ground floor. In the early years of the marriage, Femi was more buoyant in their early years of the marriage and lived in his mother’s house, rent-free. Femi and Margaret were always at loggerheads. That night I heard their loud voices from our flat. The woman said: “I want to write my ICAN to become a chartered accountant, but you have become a stumbling block. I wanted to visit my parents, you refused. You have calculated how much I would spend on them. Again, I wanted my only brother to move in with us so I can watch and direct his studies; all these you denied me as your wife. I wanted to attend my classmate’s child dedication, you refused. I am only allowed to work and bring money home. Why must it be so? The husband responded, “I am in charge.”",Columns,https://thesun.ng/relating-with-bitter-toxic-husbands/
666,"At times, a woman’s success often causes a rift in a relationship. To some men who think life will always revolve around them, that they will always be larger than life, they find it difficult to adjust when their wives rise above them. Take the case ofPeter Nwachukwu, who was recently condemned to death for the murder of his wife and popular music artiste, Osinachi Nwachukwu, known for the Christian hit song, Ekwueme, released in 2017 and which has recorded more than 136 million views on YouTube.

668,"It is worrisome that the so-called ministers of the gospel also exhibit bitterness and toxic attitudes in their marriages. Consider the case of Pastor Kola and his wife, Titi, a banker who worked with the new generation bank. On a number of occasions she came to work with physical bruises on her face or other parts of the body that could be seen. Each time colleagues asked her about the injuries she would say that fell down. Nobody knew that was facing horrendous spousal abuse at home, until the fateful day her husband stabbed her to death. The list of women who have died in the hands of bitter and toxic husbands or partners is very long.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/relating-with-bitter-toxic-husbands/
669,"A major sad truth is that several women clearly see the red flags held aloft by bitter and toxic husbands, but for reasons somewhat difficult to fathom, they stay put in the marriage instead of leaving the union. They erroneously think that man would change and become a better person. It rarely happens except the Almighty God intervened directly and brought about a miraculous change.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/relating-with-bitter-toxic-husbands/
670,"Women need to know the bitter and toxic husband is unwilling to recognise his attitudinal deficit is unlikely to change. There must be a shift in the mind, for change to happen. This is why parents should stop encouraging their children to stay intoxic relationships just to avoid “social stigma.” Some women in toxic relationships claim that they stay put and endure because of their children. No woman should remain in a toxic relationship for the sake of the children. You have to save yourself first. Leave with the children if that is possible.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/relating-with-bitter-toxic-husbands/
671,The best solution to a bitter and toxic man is to give him a wide berth.

673,"Cynthia’sstory begins in the vibrant city where she lived, a place buzzing with life and possibility. Years ago, she met Henry, a married man with a charm that captivated her from the start. Their connection was electric, a spark that ignited a passion she had never known before. Henry was everything she found alluring: cool, easy-going, and sweet. He had a way of making her feel alive, and their time together became her escape from reality.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/cynthias-chapters/
674,"For a couple of years, they dated in secret, sharing stolen moments filled with laughter, intimacy, and deep discussions about life. Henry listened to her dreams and fears, making her feel understood in a way she never felt before. With him, Cynthia felt free to be herself, shedding the constraints of the world around her. Their relationship was intense, filled with the thrill of the forbidden, and it consumed her thoughts.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/cynthias-chapters/
675,"Yet, as time passed, the complications of loving a married man began to weigh heavily on Cynthia’s heart. Despite the joy Henry brought her, she struggled with the reality of their situation. She knew their love was not conventional, and it was built on a foundation that could never fully support her hopes for a future. It was a beautiful yet painful paradox.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/cynthias-chapters/
676,"During this tumultuous period, Cynthia met Eric, a single man who entered her life like a refreshing breeze. Eric was kind, attentive, and offered her a sense of security that she had longed for. He was everything Henry was not—a man free to love her openly and build a life together. As she got to know Eric, she felt a new kind of love blossoming. It was steady and warm, a stark contrast to the fiery passion she shared with Henry.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/cynthias-chapters/

However, deep within her heart, Cynthia struggled with lingering feelings for Henry. Even after saying “I do” to Eric, her thoughts often drifted back to the man who had captured her heart years before. The connection they shared was too deep to sever completely.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/cynthias-chapters/
678,"Their relationship continued, albeit in secret. Cynthia found herself sneaking away to see Henry, drawn to him like a moth to a flame. They would meet in hidden spots, sharing moments of intimacy that felt both exhilarating and wrong. It was during these encounters that she felt most alive, yet the guilt of being unfaithful loomed over her. Their conversations were filled with everything she felt she couldn’t share with Eric—their hopes, dreams, and fears. With Henry, she felt free to express herself without judgment.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/cynthias-chapters/
679,"Cynthia grappled with the complexity of her feelings. Was this a friendship or adultery? The lines blurred as she navigated her emotions. Part of her cherished what she had with Henry, while another part felt a sense of loyalty to Eric. She loved him, yet her heart still belonged to Henry. It was a confusing emotional landscape, one that left her feeling torn between two worlds.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/cynthias-chapters/

Despite Eric’s love and devotion, there was an undeniable part of her that craved the excitement of her past.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/cynthias-chapters/
681,"Cynthia could not deny the addictive nature of her love for Henry. It was a sin she carried with her, a secret that felt both thrilling and burdensome. She often questioned whether she would ever be able to let go of Henry completely. He had been her first love in a way, the person who awakened her heart and soul. Their history was too rich to erase, and the bond they shared was unlike anything she experienced with Eric.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/cynthias-chapters/

Blood is made up three major components: a clear liquid called plasma in the other two are suspended and carried to tissues and organs of the body; blood cells of which there are two types (red blood cells and white blood cells) and the platelets. The platelets help the blood to clot. Clotting stops the blood from flowing out of the body when a vein or artery ruptures or is broken by traumatic force or a cut. The red blood cells which blood its reddish colour carry oxygen to the cells and remove carbon dioxide while the white blood cells help the body to fight off infection.,Columns,https://thesun.ng/dangers-warning-signs-of-blood-clot-3/

In such situations it can lead to a medical emergency.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/dangers-warning-signs-of-blood-clot-3/

Nonetheless, the body gives some signs of blood clot “wahala” and the severity depends on a number of factors. The chances of someone having a clot is higher if the such individual is recovering from surgery or had to sit for many hours on a flight or in a wheelchair; the person is obese or overweight, has diabetes or has high cholesterol level or above 60 years.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/dangers-warning-signs-of-blood-clot-3/

The poor dear I cannot say I blame her. “I am sure that Zara put something in my drink, that conniving, despicable girl,” Kaycee said darkly. “Ok, calm down Kaycee, I know you’re upset. Later in the day I called Zara to register our displeasure but she showed no remorse and instead told me to stop being a cry Baby over a ‘little harmless joke’. Zara needs to be taught a lesson and the best way is to give her a taste of her own medicine. I will come up with a plan, I assured Kaycee with a devious smile and Jasmine had already said she wanted to be involved. I do not know if I should involve her. Jasmine would add a dark side to the plan that might not sit well with Kaycee. I will wait till I get to that bridge before deciding. I had to do a quick trip out of the Country, it was work related. I am back now and stressed so I am thrilled to be stepping out of town for a day. I sincerely hope it’s not more than a day; I really don’t have the luxury of time. I hope I do not regret agreeing to this outing. “Ready gorgeous?” Jasmine yelled from outside honking her horn. It was 7.00am on Friday. Jasmine had offered to come pick me and I had agreed in my exhausted state. Mom who is an early bird will definitely be up; the loud honk was enough to annoy anyone so before my Mom gets upset its better I do something about it.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/there-are-a-lot-of-scoundrels-out-there/

Jasmine wore shredded jean, a tank top and snickers; all in baby pink. She looked like a Barbie doll and really sweet. “Jasmine come with me to my room, I want to discuss something with you,” Mom said smiling. She asked the Steward to bring them some tea and biscuits. I had just come out of the shower and so had a little time to dress up and pack my stuff. All through I kept wondering what Mom was discussing with Jasmine. One never can tell with aged Parents; only one thing is upper most on their minds; marriage, children, career and then money, that is the order and priority to them. I wore flats and a bum short with a tank top all in pink, which by the way was the theme colour of the day. I was later to find out we had a theme colour per day ( just as I suspected it was a whole weekend ) and my clothes were going to be provided so I didn’t need to pack anything but I did not listen to the girls.

719,"After what seemed like forever and after my 3rd interruption, my Mom finally ‘released’ Jasmine. What she had to say was hilarious and at the same time somewhat upsetting. We said our goodbyes when Mom was finally done with Jasmine. “So what was that all about?” I asked Jasmine as she pulled away from the curb. “Actually Mama was berating me on our single status and even suggested arranging prospects for us,” she said laughing referring to my Mother as ‘Mama’ like I call her. “Seriously?” I asked uncomfortable with this new twist on the ‘get married’ siege. Mama had taken it up a notch. “I am sure you explained to her that it is important we make the right choice, men are everywhere but not every man is a husband material. There are a lot of scoundrels out there,” I said darkly remembering our past. We eventually got to a Resort somewhere on the outskirts of town; it had an African theme setting and it’s absolutely beautiful. We were the first to arrive in spite of the delay but within the hour the girls all arrived and everywhere just lit up. My girls sure know how to be the cynosure of all eyes. The colour theme for dinner was white. I wearily eyed the dress that had been laid out on the bed for me. It was a crop top on a macro jean skirt and a filmy, flirtatious lacy dress shirt and my shoes were heely boots of course all in white. It felt strange wearing it. I wasn’t sure I wanted to wear it. It was overly sexy for me and I am not the obvious kind, I am more an ‘understated, laid back, sensual’ kind of girl. I never like obvious, to me it makes the girl look trashy. But then rules are rules and one of the rules is that I am expected to wear whatever is given to me. I wore it in the spirit of sportsmanship.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/there-are-a-lot-of-scoundrels-out-there/

So, let me give a little explanation. It is the inimical act of politicians waking up and just leaving their political parties and moving over to another one in power at the local government, state or federal level. The bug has been in our politics for long but currently it is assuming a frightening dimension.

But the APC is having the far better part. Was it anticipated, the answer is yes. If antecedent tells a story then it was clear from his ascension to power that President Bola Tinubu would work to consolidate his hold on power, and one sure way of getting that through would be tacit decimation of the opposition political parties.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/linking-the-state-to-the-centre/

The industrious eldest wife was the real financial backbone of the family, not Daddy-fine-boy. And she indulged him all the days of his life. So the other two wives would not disgrace their husband, she would buy fabrics for the three of them and give Pa Shodiya to give the three of them. When the other two wives threatened to tear papa’s agbada for not providing food for their children, Grandma Shodiya would call her husband aside, give him money and he would come out of his chambers like a big boy and shame his nagging wives with money.

This isn’t merely skimming through case files; it’s a deep, immersive engagement with every facet of the case, leaving no stone unturned.

He explains, “As a rule, I never feel comfortable until I have prepared my case and prepared the case of the defence as well. I put myself in a position where I say: ‘What if I was the lawyer for the other side? What would be my argument on this?’ So I always prepare my case and the case of the defence. That has always been my strategy.” This proactive “devil’s advocate” approach allows him to identify potential weaknesses in his own case and preemptively dismantle the opposition’s arguments.

This demonstrates not just thoroughness but a profound understanding of legal precedent and its nuanced application. In high-stakes litigation, such as the presidential election petition he handled for President Obasanjo, this meticulousness proved invaluable.

He aptly quotes Proverbs 18:17, highlighting how the initial presentation of a case can be compelling, but effective questioning can dismantle even the most persuasive testimony. For Babalola, cross-examination is not just about challenging a witness; it’s an art form, a strategic dance of questions designed to elicit admissions and expose inconsistencies.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/100-famous-lawyers-afe-babalola-art-of-legal-thinking/

Yet the principle of restraint, which should guide responsible journalism and activism, is routinely ignored in the rush to go viral.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/activism-our-toxic-social-media-climate/
806,"Meanwhile, the media and public discourse are failing to address what truly matters: the performance of our elected officials. As we approach the crucial midterm point of President Bola Tinubu’s administration, discussions should centre around accountability, governance outcomes, and the tangible dividends of democracy. Instead, the national conversation is being hijacked by gossip, ethnic posturing, and the fevered plotting of how to unseat a sitting president three years before the next general elections.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/activism-our-toxic-social-media-climate/
807,"Similarly, the ongoing political quarrel between former Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike and his successor, Governor Sim Fubara, continues to be sensationalised far beyond its actual impact on national politics. While the matter is already before the courts, it remains a hot topic in public discourse. Rather than allow the legal process or a political resolution to take its course, media and online commentators keep stoking the flames. This kind of persistent muscle-flexing has yielded no progress since the crisis began and serves only to distract from more pressing governance challenges.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/activism-our-toxic-social-media-climate/
808,"In all of this, we must not lose sight of what responsible civic engagement should look like. Real activism demands clarity, integrity and a commitment to truth.

Jaji painted a harrowing picture of attacks, mass kidnappings and general lawlessness that have left his constituents devastated and displaced.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/mr-president-the-security-challenge-is-hitting-harder/
811,"Over 200 of such attacks have taken place in communities across Kaura Namoda Local Government Area alone, including Dayo, Banga, Gabaki, Korea, and Madura, according to the lawmaker. In one instance, 60 people were abducted in Banga. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of N30 million. Out of those abducted, 10 were killed, and the fate of the remaining 50 hangs in the balance, he said. The chilling aspect of his narration was one in which a pregnant woman gave birth in captivity and her newborn twins were thrown to dogs by a bandit leader. He also gave the instance of a boy with epilepsy who was executed for falling in the presence of a bandit. “A pregnant woman was abducted. She gave birth to twins while she was in captivity. Then the leader of the bandits took the twins, threw them to his dog. The dog ate the twins one by one,” Jaji recalled.

812,"In Borno, a gory online video depicted dead soldiers on the floor with their faces covered with green leaves. Sobs and anguish accompanied each face uncovered and the deceased recognised by colleagues. The soldiers were victims of recent Boko Haram terrorist attacks on a military base in the Marte Local Government Area of Borno State. Agency reports indicated that the terrorists took over Marte in the early hours of Monday, May 12, and unleashed mayhem, killing over 10 soldiers. “They (terrorists) burnt down armored tanks and made away with arms and ammunition,” a source said. The assault on the soldiers came on the heels of an alarm by the Borno State governor, Babagana Zulum, on the resurgence of Boko Haram attacks in the state. Zulum explained the renewed attacks as indications of the government losing ground to the terrorist group.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/mr-president-the-security-challenge-is-hitting-harder/
813,"Elsewhere, no fewer than 24 farmers were killed across four local government areas of Benue State between Friday and Saturday by armed men suspected to be bandits. From Sokoto came the reports that gunmen loyal to bandit kingpin, Bello Turji, had attacked and sacked four communities in Isa Local Government Area of the State, including Bafarawa, the hometown of former governor Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa. The assault also affected the communities of Gebe, Kamarawa, Garin Fadama and Haruwai.

815,"Now, whether it is in Zamfara, Borno, Sokoto or Enugu, the situation is no longer funny. Every Nigerian has become a target or victim, in one way or another. Insecurity in any part of the country is a threat to the remaining units. That is why the government should take the matter more seriously. More so, the Constitution is emphatic that protection of the life and property of the people is the primary function of the government. It is akin to a sacred duty. There is no doubt that the government has put up measures to address the monster of insecurity in the land. We have been told of Tucano jets and other military hardware procured for the prosecution of the war. There have also been claims of military alliances and cooperation with neighbouring countries and multilateral bodies towards checking the menace. Reports have equally regularly credited the military with successes in dislodging or neutralizing the insurgents.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/mr-president-the-security-challenge-is-hitting-harder/
816,"Unfortunately, while the claims of triumphs and successes are being appropriated, realities on ground paint different pictures. The truth, right now, is that in many parts of the country, the people are no longer safe, they cannot farm, they cannot trade and are internally displaced. For a country that is not at war with another nation, passing through this route can be quite harrowing and and humiliating. It is nothing short of assaulting the sovereignty of the nation. The troubling aspect of it all is the report that Boko Haram is using drones against the soldiers in Borno. The question therefore is: what happens to the touted Tucano Jets and other military hardware?",Columns,https://thesun.ng/mr-president-the-security-challenge-is-hitting-harder/
817,"The war in the North East has gone beyond a police action or what can be treated with kid gloves.

Resorting to placatory overtures to the sect through middle men, concessions, monetary compensations, outright appeasement and even in most ridiculous instance, integrating the so-called repentant members into the armed forces, have clearly shown to be unproductive. If anything, such pacifist efforts are being mismanaged and misinterpreted as signs of weakness on the part of the government by the insurgents. You will, of course, not blame the miscreants for feeling indulged. If for merely proclaiming self-determination a certain part of the country was visited with military actions under various code-names and operational briefs, Boko Haram members who have caused humongous harm to the country being cajoled with different offers to lay down their arms, have every reason to assume some entitlement.",Columns,https://thesun.ng/mr-president-the-security-challenge-is-hitting-harder/
819,"Something drastic needs to be done going forward. The rising spate of insecurity in different parts of the country is a present danger and constitutes serious threat to the corporate existence of the nation. A time comes when a man, group or organisation stands firm and declares; thus far, no farther.

While cultism has long been a deeply entrenched menace in the social and criminal landscape of Edo State—festering in schools, communities and even political spaces—the narrative is shifting. For the first time in a long time, we are witnessing a government not only speaking against cultism but taking decisive steps to dismantle its roots and consequences.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/why-nuj-nba-asuu-clergymen-csos-traditional-rulers-must-endorse-okpebholos-anti-cultism-fight/

It is about reclaiming campuses, streets, markets, shrines and sacred spaces that have been infiltrated by darkness.

The governor initiated amendments to the state’s anti-cultism law, tightening loopholes and providing stiffer sentences for both perpetrators and enablers. The law also empowers community vigilantes and recognized security outfits to legally collaborate with the police on cult-related intelligence and operations.

In a shift from past approaches, the state government is leveraging the influence of traditional rulers, pastors, and imams to delegitimize cultism as a means of power.

He has made himself a movement and a brand through outstanding performance. In short, he has revolutionised political leadership and governance in Enugu State, and one needs no light to see it because it is too visible and impactful. He is indeed the anchorage of political relevance and presence in Enugu State and beyond ahead of the 2027 elections.

Apparently, the founding fathers of the newspaper appreciated that in a world where the lie reigns and dresses like truth, it is onerous to bear truth. A striking metaphor of the tragedy of truth today is a 19th century legend, depicted by Jean-Léon Gérome’s 1896 painting, “The truth Coming out of the Well”.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/oloyedes-burden-of-truth-and-integrity/

The unsuspecting Truth felt that the water was nice and undressed with The Lie to bathe. Suddenly, The Lie jumped out of the water, put on the clothes of The Truth and ran away. The Truth ran out to pursue The Lie but the latter had disappeared into the world, which turned its gaze away in rage on seeing the naked Truth running around.The poor Truth returned to the well to hide forever while The Lie moves around disguised as The Truth, satisfying the needs of the world because the world, and Nigeria is its microcosm, is not interested in seeing the naked Truth.

A Latin word that derives from ‘integer’, the same integer everyone learnt in primary school as depicting a whole number as opposed to a fraction, meaning whole, intact and complete, integrity describes the quality of being untainted, upright, honest or having strict moral and ethical code. Though the qualities of truth and integrity cannot be said to be extinct, among the few Nigerians that epitomise them in the public space is the Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Emeritus Is-haq Olanrewaju Oloyede, the acclaimed winner of the maiden edition of the prestigious Gani Fawehinmi Integrity Award in 2018.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/oloyedes-burden-of-truth-and-integrity/

He would obfuscate the matter, stonewall the critics and give reasons to extricate himself. Afterall, it wasn’t his personal fault.

But it has been specially so since the All Progressives Congress (APC) political party happened to rulership in our country about 10 years ago. Virtually nothing is thrown open for engagement, debate, conversation and contestation by critical stakeholders. The dominant practice is for a few persons, many or all, with jaundiced and sectarian views, to huddle in what could pass as a coven, to make weighty decisions and foist the same on the rest of us as a fait accompli. Some of those issues do not enjoy needed national consensus nor widespread buy-in. Often, some of those decisions and impositions arouse suspicions and stir bad blood across the population segments. For some persons who are determined to foist their sectarian agenda on the rest, nothing is sacred. And the potential cost to the fabric of the country is immaterial to them. That perhaps explains why in the 1999 constitution of Nigeria as altered so far, there are disproportionate mentions and provisions in the document in favour of Islam than Christianity. This is happening in a so-called secular or multi-religious country. Of course, some Muslims especially from parts of the north of our country do not accept the secularity of Nigeria. Not in the past. Not today.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/arabic-agency-diploma-versus-waec-neco-certificates/
1880,"Those in this group regard Nigeria as their heritage and inheritance. Are they misguided? Not really, if we recall the long-standing vow and obvious commitment of the offsprings of Uthman Dan Fodio to transport the Qur’an from the scorching environment of the sahel region and dip the same in the Atlantic ocean of the cool rainforest. That commitment has not waned. In spite of denial, it was the hidden reason behind the 2023 Muslim – Muslim presidential ticket. Also the zeal to dip the Qur’an into the Atlantic ocean, which is really about violent conversion of so-called unbelievers through Jihad, is at the core of the low intensity and lingering civil war in Nigeria manifesting in the terrorism of Isamist groups such as Boko Haram, Ansaru, ISWAP, among others. It’s also this desire that drives the bloody sackings of indigenous communities in Plateau and Benue states, and other places and the occupation of their ancestral lands by the armed invaders. The recurring attacks on military formations in parts of the north by the Islamists are parts of the larger plans to instill fears in the hearts of the people, especially non-Muslims, and weaken their resistance to making Nigeria a Muslim country.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/arabic-agency-diploma-versus-waec-neco-certificates/
1881,"There’s a profound saying that if you want to cripple a country, attack its education. And those who are hell bent on the dominance of Muslims and their religion, Islam, have turned their attention to the education sector. Education is already an Achilles heel of our country. Depending on who you reference, there are between 15-20 million children who are out of school, arguably the highest figure in the world. In addition, no segment of Nigeria’s education is settled and fit for purpose. Indeed, last week there was a national uproar over a rigged mass failure in a qualifying examination for entry into universities by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). In the wake of the disaster, the board perfunctorily claimed that the mass failure was due to candidates’ lack of seriousness. But as it turned out and after an audit by people in the know who worked with JAMB officials, it was found that the board was responsible for that disaster. A teenager who was shocked by the result awarded to her reportedly took her life in the aftermath of the incident. Apart from the recent JAMB saga, the truth is that our country’s educational system is in tatters. It’s virtually devoid of useful content. Teachers at all levels of public schools are not well prepared, they are ill-equipped and unmotivated. Failed and failing infrastructure are the hallmarks of our schools. The picture is gloomy and depressing. And the implications for the future of the country are dire and foreboding.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/arabic-agency-diploma-versus-waec-neco-certificates/
1882,"It is in the midst of all these that a surreptitious attempt is ongoing to introduce a clearly sectarian qualifying certificate to rival the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) school certificate (WASC) and the National Examination Council (NECO) certificate for entry into tertiary institutions. The certificate is being promoted and issued by the National Board for Arabic and Islamic Studies (NBAIS). Our attention was drawn to the unfolding situation when we sighted the draft (the petition has since been formalized and published) of a letter titled An Emergency Petition To National Education Regulators: The NBAIS Certificate Policy-A Direct Threat To Nigeria’s Educational Integrity, by persons who identified themselves as members of the National Prayer Altar. The National Prayer Altar comprises over 100 Christian groups.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/arabic-agency-diploma-versus-waec-neco-certificates/
1883,"It has been said repeatedly by those who should know that one of the easiest ways to cripple a country is to infect its educational system with a debilitating virus. There’s little doubt that the imposition of this sectarian NBAIS certificate as an alternative and acceptable entry requirement into our tertiary schools, to rival the widely recognized and accepted WASC and NECO could prove a death nail on the flailing education sector of our country. It could be disputed but it is fairly widely recognized that the quality of the products of our education started suffering from reversals when entry requirements into higher institutions of learning were manipulated through the establishment of schools of remedial studies in parts of the country especially the north. Candidates who failed the school certificate examination were shepherded into schools of basic studies with affiliations to universities. Schools of basic studies with suspect facilities and teaching staff became pipelines into tertiary institutions. Quality was sacrificed so that many of the students in the north would catch up with those in the south. And it has been a slippery slope ever since to the detriment of the country.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/arabic-agency-diploma-versus-waec-neco-certificates/
1884,"The alarm raised by the National Prayer Altar (NPA) should be seen for what it is – a patriotic call to save this country from a clear and present danger. For the avoidance of doubt, NBAIS has been in existence in the country since the 1960s, but it had operated largely as a non-governmental agency. It was not until about 2011 that it was controversially adopted as a government institution. Its doors were slightly opened to allow non-Muslims on its staff register and then for candidates of other religious persuasions to sit for its examination. Obviously, these were cosmetic changes to hoodwink the unsuspecting public. Discerning members of the public and the NPA were not deceived, hence the ongoing public outcry on the dangers of equating NBAIS with WAEC and NECO. The argument of NPA in their petition to the regulators of Nigeria’s already shambolic education on NBAIS’s certificate was logical and surgical. So, we will be generous in extracting excerpts from their letter of warning to those who want to destroy this country. NPA rightly said that the “most effective way to destroy a nation (ours is a country, anyway) is not through sophisticated weaponry but by lowering the quality of its education. When education collapses, every pillar of national life – governance, economy, justice, health, and ethics – begins to be eroded. A compromised education sector does not just fail the students (as in the case of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, last week), it fails the nation”.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/arabic-agency-diploma-versus-waec-neco-certificates/
1885,"The NPA and other Nigerians do not have any rights to deny the sectarian examination body the quest to train and certify its own so long as its certification was not thrown into the mix to pollute the system. Againwe reference the NPA alert to buttress the danger. It said: “Whereas we do not begrudge NBAIS for its efforts in producing and certificating candidates for its related religious and cultural services, whereas we do not question the integrity of that Board and its specialist but culturally and religiously exclusive (and we dare say, partisan) education, we worry that the policy is not just ill-conceived but pokes daringly at the religious and cultural diversity of the Nigerian state. It is a dagger in the heart of national unity and a potential catastrophic blow to any hope of restoring credibility to our broken education system. Our position (and that of the countless other individuals and institutions that support our concern) is non-negotiable: the policy (of NBAIS certificate as the equivalent of WASC and NECO) must be terminated immediately”. The Arabic certificate is neither an international or regional certificate which is awarded by recognized regional educational bodies benchmarked by global agencies including the UNESCO, ECOWAS, and AfCFTA. NBAIS enjoys no such accreditation",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/arabic-agency-diploma-versus-waec-neco-certificates/
1886,"In addition, as NPA said, the Arabic certificate lacked a standardized STEM ( Science, Tech, Engineering, Math)? rigour. It has no balanced and tested humanities and civic education, nor an inclusive cross-cultural, and secular academic structure. To allow NBAIS to play at the level of WAEC and NECO will be to institutionalize religious and cultural discrimination against other Nigerians of different religious and cultural persuasions. It will be provocative and potentially explosive. The NBAIS certificate policy is discriminatory to the extent that it provides additional entry options into higher institutions for certain candidates whilst others struggle with two. As NPA poignantly posited: “Someone from one part of Nigeria has to have WAEC and/or NECO to be admitted to study medicine, law, engineering, accountancy, Christian Religious Knowledge, or mathematics, whereas someone else in a different part of the same country only has to speak their native language and recite their traditional creed to win the same spaces that everyone else rigorously competes for“.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/arabic-agency-diploma-versus-waec-neco-certificates/
1887,"Over the years, and since this dispensation, our rulers have hidden under the guise of reforms to introduce religion to our education. NBAIS certificate is yet another manifestation of this dangerous trend. The other time the country was wracked by what should be the acceptable dress code for students at the primary and secondary school levels. In Osun state, for example, some Christian students had to don choir robes to counter the hijab and flowing gowns allowed for Muslim students. While we fight over inanities in defence of our largely shallow faith, nobody worries about the contents of our education, the structure of the curricular, instructional materials, infrastructure in our schools, the quality of the teaching staff and their motivation, access to education in terms of affordability, and other critical mandates. There are no interrogations about how the federal government or the subnationals are striving to meet the minimum prescribed annual budgetary allocations to education, or even whether the miserly allocations are put to good use or stolen by the many sharks in our educational system and their collaborators.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/arabic-agency-diploma-versus-waec-neco-certificates/
1888,"There are many challenges confronting our educational system. This quest to make the obviously sectarian and dubious NBAIS certificate an equivalent of WAEC and NECO certificates for entry into tertiary institutions, or for job placements in government institutions will do this country no good.

1891,"As the member of the 9th Senate and current Governor of Kaduna State who also belongs to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Uba Sani holds a position that is most critical to the peace and development of the North and therefore absolutely qualified to respond to the views of others on the region and the whole country. He reserves the right to, either as a counter-argument or simple clarification respond to the issues being raised against the government of Kaduna State or even the Federal Government by some political opponents.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/uba-sanis-bluntness-on-norths-woes/
1892,"It is, therefore, with the usual courage for which he is known that he acknowledges the predicaments of the North in particular and Nigeria in general, but always strongly attributes the persistence of the identified problems to the prolonged neglect that the North suffered when most of those critics were in positions of authority and could therefore have dealt with them. Atiku Abubakar who was a very powerful vice president, Nasir El-Rufa’i who was at various times the Director General of Bureau of Public Enterprises, Minister of Federal Capital Territory and two-term governor of Kaduna State as well as some others like them who have turned themselves into regular attackers of even the most well-intentioned policies of the APC-controlled government are, by his judgment, guilty in this regard.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/uba-sanis-bluntness-on-norths-woes/

1898,"Overthe past few years, electric vehicles (EVs) have taken the global auto industry by storm. In 2023 alone, over 14 million EVs were sold worldwide which accounted for nearly 18 percent of total car sales, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). From America to China to many advanced countries and even some African countries, governments have been rolling out policies to phase out internal combustion engines and promote cleaner alternatives. But in Nigeria, the conversation around EVs remains muted and this calls for serious concerns.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/hype-hope-of-electric-vehicles-in-nigeria/
1899,"Unlike other serious countries, our journey towards adoption of EVs has barely begun. Although companies like Jet Motors and Stallion Group have introduced electric buses and sedans but they’re not getting enough support which makes their market presence unyielding. Since EVs are programmed around charging, the charging infrastructure is also nearly non-existent. A 2022 report by the Nigerian Energy Support Programme showed that there are fewer than 10 public charging stations in the entire country, mostly concentrated in Lagos and Abuja. Imagine that for a country of over 220million population, obviously that’s not enough to inspire consumer confidence.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/hype-hope-of-electric-vehicles-in-nigeria/
1900,"The economic argument for EVs is also challenging in Nigeria’s context. The average EV costs significantly more than the typical tokunbo (used) petrol car. Even with lower running costs, the upfront price is a barrier for most Nigerians. When over 60 percent of Nigerians live below the poverty line, and the average new car sells for over ₦15 million, the notion of buying an electric vehicle becomes implausible for the majority.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/hype-hope-of-electric-vehicles-in-nigeria/
1901,"Then there’s the issue of electricity itself. Nigeria suffers from chronic power shortages, with national grid electricity barely reaching 5,000MW for a population of over 220 million. National grid collapse, frequent blackouts and unreliable supply make the idea of charging a vehicle at home seem far-fetched. Unless grid stability improves significantly, large-scale EV usage is not feasible. However, there are glimmers of hope. Nigeria has some of the largest lithium deposits in Africa, the key raw material for EV batteries. If properly harnessed, this could offer a strategic entry point into the EV supply chain. Countries like Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo are already leveraging their mineral wealth to attract battery manufacturers. If the FG and state governments do not act swiftly, Nigeria risks missing out if it doesn’t act fast.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/hype-hope-of-electric-vehicles-in-nigeria/
1902,"Moreover, the federal government did announce in 2021 the National Automotive Industry Development Plan (NAIDP) 2021–2031, which includes incentives for EV manufacturing. But implementation has been slow. There is no clear roadmap, no dedicated EV policy framework, and no tax incentives for EV buyers or assemblers. Without these, private players have little motivation to invest. As for the environmental argument for EVs, well, that is compelling. Nigeria’s major cities like Lagos, Port Harcourt and Kano suffer from rising air pollution, much of it from vehicle emissions. According to the World Health Organization, Lagos alone records PM2.5 levels nearly seven times higher than recommended. Reducing fossil fuel vehicles could help improve urban air quality and public health, especially among low-income communities who live close to roads and traffic hubs.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/hype-hope-of-electric-vehicles-in-nigeria/
1903,"But if Nigeria is to make the shift, the conversation must move from symbolism to substance. Pilot programmes are not enough. The federal and state governments must fund charging infrastructure, offer import duty waivers on EV components, and build technical capacity for EV maintenance and assembly. This requires coordinated action across energy, transport, and industrial sectors.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/hype-hope-of-electric-vehicles-in-nigeria/

1993,"JAMB should concentrate on how to better the conduct of the examination and the admission process into the universities and other higher institutions. The JAMB’s emphasis on generating more revenue has robbed it of the energy to deliver quality UTME hence the mass failure recorded in the 2025 UTME.

1994,Some of these courses are reportedly sold to the highest bidders in most of the public universities every admission season. It can also happen in some private universities as well. Some cough out up to N1million or N2 million for some of these courses and parents pay dearly to procure such admissions. It could be more in some of these universities. Going back to the old admission system where each university is in charge will likely worsen the situation. What JAMB must do now is to sit down and review the admission process in public and private universities where admission to these courses is riddled with monumental corruption.,Opinion,https://thesun.ng/jamb-and-its-travails/
1995,"Despite the advent of JAMB, it has not stopped admission racketeering. Clever Nigerians still procure admissions with money even if they passed for such courses. JAMB should intentionally overhaul its conduct of UTME in terms of timing, allocation of candidates to centres and the timeframe for the purchase of JAMB form, mock exam and the period for the real conduct of the exam. JAMB should stop fixing examination for 6.30 am. JAMB should cancel the 6.30 am exams.

2000,"Educationalperformance is basically hinged on what educational psychologists refer to as growth, readiness and maturation; and feeding pattern (diet) environment (conduciveness) and motivation (stimulating conditions) make for their effectiveness. Even when raw scores are produced after examinations serving as statistical input, they are not solely determinant factors for decision making like how to admit candidates in over 270 universities in Nigeria including about 70 public universities. If you attend Educational Measurement and Evaluation class like one attended led by Professor Godswill Obioma, on face value the results collated by JAMB are positively skewed reflecting a Mode in the range of 151-160, a Median in the range of 161-170 and a Mean in the range of 181-190. Glitches occurred, no doubt, and it behooves human analytical mind if the algorithm used is faulty to review certain “determinant” factors in the matrix of decision making.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/utme-scores-probe-autism-and-brain-glut/
2001,"One of such factors like noted by Professor Obaji, the first female Minister of Education in Nigeria, is epiphenomenal issues relating to high score earners – are they caused by conduciveness or stimulating conditions or even fraudulent environment; providing clues and keys by the computer without stimulating items (questions) as if it is mere guess work examination like a candidate noted; on and off rebooting of the computer in circumstances where electricity supply is not steady; circuitous diversion in the likes of hacking where a parallel platform is provided to do the examination while those visually monitored in form of proctoring are mere “ghosts” in reversal.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/utme-scores-probe-autism-and-brain-glut/
2002,"According to Professor Obaji, when post-UTME examination was introduced in 2005, it was because most of those who obtained high scores in JAMB are not performing in co-relationship with such scores in their first year in the university; and post – UTME helped in sifting the “grains from the chaffs”. It also helped the government in reducing university intake such that the capacity carrying values of the universities were respected to an extent that full capacity carrying of the universities was not fully met, making it really a selection process based on second level decision making. With current JAMB result, a reverse trend sets-in as greater number of low scores is noticed which could not be divorced from a cumulative problem of long term cheating that has now resulted in autistic syndrome.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/utme-scores-probe-autism-and-brain-glut/
2003,"Autism, in neuronal terms, is seen as a disorder relating to repetitive, restricted and inflexible patterns of behavior, interests and activities as well as “not communicating effectively with the computer”. Plasticity of the brain leads to adaptive behavior as environment or stimuli change; but an autistic person like people permanently stimulated by electronic devices, either with earphones permanently plugged to the ears or stimulating always virtual conditions, lack brain plasticity that tends to be the norm of efficient and effective cognitive development. Disorderly cognitive development sets-in, and it leads to epiphenomenal cases of autistic spectrum extension, joining even those who were not supposed to be on the spectrum if the stimulating factors had not deteriorated to remain fixated by electronic or robotic devices.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/utme-scores-probe-autism-and-brain-glut/

By observation, fixation or misplaced repetitiveness could be the cause, and computer environment would have been non-adaptive to him. Most candidates who took the JAMB examinations are still struggling to attune their brain to computer environment. In all life situations maturation and growth patterns are not the same for everyone – early risers and laggards still remain the norm, and when growth is retarded by either feeding pattern or human manipulated environmental development, readiness and motivation could encounter mismatch which could drag more people into autistic spectrum.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/utme-scores-probe-autism-and-brain-glut/

2019,"The recent imposition of tariffs by the US has sparked intense debate and raised questions about their economic rationale and motivations. A closer look at the structure of these tariffs reveals a targeted approach, focusing primarily on the goods sector while leaving the services sector largely untouched. This distinction is crucial, given the contrasting trade balances in these two sectors.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-unintended-consequences-of-us-tariffs/
2020,"The US faces significant trade deficits in the goods sector, importing more goods than it exports. However, the services sector tells a different story.

2127,"InNigeria, few issues stir as much raw emotion as the price and quality of electricity. Everywhere across the length and breadth of the country electricity supply is unstable. Over the years, successive governments have insisted that Nigerians are underpaying for electricity. The solution? Increase the tariff under the guise of reflective pricing. Yet, month after month, citizens grope in the dark, both literally and metaphorically.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-myth-of-reflective-electricity-pricing-in-nigeria/
2128,"Now, the current administration is singing the same old song. And while the government tells us it is about efficiency and subsidy removal, the reality is far more sinister. The rich opt-out out of solar panels. Aso Rock itself is installing solar, admitting silently that even at the highest Band A tariff, the power supply is unreliable and the cost unsustainable. What, then, is the fate of the average Nigerian?",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-myth-of-reflective-electricity-pricing-in-nigeria/
2129,"To understand the electricity pricing debate, we must step back. In the last 30 years, Nigerians have endured epileptic power supply, regardless of which party is in power. NEPA (jokingly dubbed Never Expect Power Always) became PHCN, and PHCN was unbundled into Generation Companies (GenCos), Distribution Companies (DisCos), and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). The reforms were touted as the beginning of a new era. Instead, they marked the dawn of privatized suffering.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-myth-of-reflective-electricity-pricing-in-nigeria/
2130,"Tariffs have increased over 10 times since 2000. Yet, the power supply remains poor, unstable, and unavailable in many communities. While the government mouths “cost-reflective pricing,” consumers are asked to pay for darkness. The prepaid meter, intended to end estimated billing, has become a new tool of oppression, many are still without them, and those who have them often complain of fast-draining units with no clear explanation.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-myth-of-reflective-electricity-pricing-in-nigeria/
2131,"So, what is reflective pricing? In theory, it’s a system where electricity tariffs reflect the actual cost of generating and distributing power. In practice, however, it’s a blunt instrument used to extract more money from citizens without accountability or improvement in service.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-myth-of-reflective-electricity-pricing-in-nigeria/
2132,"The situation is so dire that the supposed economic logic collapses under scrutiny. What is the point of reflective pricing when generation is still less than 6,000MW for over 200 million people? What is the point of reflective pricing when transmission lines are outdated and often overloaded? What is the point of reflective pricing when distribution networks are fragmented, inefficient, and corrupt? What is the point of reflective pricing when every customer cannot have pre-paid metre?",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-myth-of-reflective-electricity-pricing-in-nigeria/

2140,"Third, Nigeria must embrace local energy solutions. Encouraging the development of localized mini-grids and solar cooperatives, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas, will boost energy independence. Communities should be incentivized to manage and own their power infrastructure.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-myth-of-reflective-electricity-pricing-in-nigeria/

2247,"Itis often said that “when the roots are deep, there is no reason to fear the wind.” Six months after stepping into the stormy shoes of governance, Senator Monday Okpebholo has proven that leadership is not about noise but about substance. He did not come in as a messiah with lofty promises wrapped in sweet speeches. Instead, he came with a broom, a hoe and a plan—to clear the debris of the past and rebuild Edo State with his hands in the soil and his ears to the ground.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/six-months-of-gov-okpebholos-common-sense-governance/
2248,"To understand the significance of Okpebholo’s leadership, one must revisit where Edo has come from. For eight years, the people of Edo were like tenants in their own house. Governance became a monologue—a conversation among the elite, with little regard for the voices of ordinary citizens. Development was spoken of in press conferences but absent on the streets. Roads were death traps. Civil servants were demoralized. Food became gold in the market. Schools were in ruins. Hospitals were gasping for breath. Security became a private affair. The people were left holding the empty shell of promises.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/six-months-of-gov-okpebholos-common-sense-governance/
2249,"But Governor Okpebholo came in like a farmer who understands that, no matter how lush a forest looks, it cannot feed a hungry man. He is going back to the basics—fixing what matters. In just six months, a fresh wind of responsible governance is blowing through the state. The drums of disconnected leadership have gone silent, and the rhythm of accountability has taken over.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/six-months-of-gov-okpebholos-common-sense-governance/
2250,"Governor Okpebholo has chosen the narrow path—a path often ignored by those who prefer skyscrapers in the sky to pothole-free roads. He understands that no man eats blueprints. The real test of governance is not in ribbon-cutting ceremonies but in whether a farmer in Iruekpen can get his produce to the market without getting stuck in the mud, or whether a civil servant in Ikpeshi can afford a meal after salary.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/six-months-of-gov-okpebholos-common-sense-governance/
2251,"From day one, Governor Okpebholo made it clear that he would not be governed by ego or revenge. Unlike his predecessor, who often seemed more interested in vendettas than value, the current governor has shown maturity. He is fixing roads, not picking fights. He is restoring dignity, not renaming institutions to settle political scores.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/six-months-of-gov-okpebholos-common-sense-governance/
2252,"One of the greatest indicators of a functioning government is the strength of its civil service. For years, Edo’s civil service was reduced to a ghost town. The previous administration preferred consultants who drained the system without transferring knowledge. The state became a feeding ground for outsiders while the real engine room of governance—the civil servants—were sidelined and starved of opportunities.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/six-months-of-gov-okpebholos-common-sense-governance/
2253,"Governor Okpebholo saw the rot and went to work. He began recruiting qualified personnel, reversing the decay. The handover chaos with the state’s IT systems is a metaphor for how broken things were. Obaseki’s IT consultant refused to release login details and digital assets of the state, exposing a system built on control rather than continuity. But Okpebholo’s team rolled up their sleeves and began the slow but steady process of digital recovery. “When a pot breaks, you don’t cry over the clay—you mold another one.”",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/six-months-of-gov-okpebholos-common-sense-governance/
2254,"When Okpebholo said during his campaign that “Edo will become a construction site,” many dismissed it as political talk. But he has matched words with action. Roads that had become symbols of abandonment are being rehabilitated. He is not waiting for the federal government to fix federal roads. He understands that a bad road doesn’t ask if it’s federal or state before it kills.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/six-months-of-gov-okpebholos-common-sense-governance/

Ambrose Alli University (AAU), once a proud academic citadel, became a theater of strikes. Lecturers became street protesters.

Food production is being scaled.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/six-months-of-gov-okpebholos-common-sense-governance/

2298,"TheEuropean Union (EU) was created in 1993 as a geopolitical entity covering a large portion of the European continent. A unique economicandpolitical partnership between 27 European countries that has delivered over half a century of peace, stability, and prosperity.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/
2299,"It was bornnot just as a product of economic integration but as a project ofpeace,freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law by design’’. Just five years after the end of World War 11, the Shuman Declaration proposed a revolutionary idea: that former enemies could bind together their industrial production – of coal and steel, the very materials of war – to make future conflict ‘’not merely unthinkable, but materially, impossible.’’",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/
2300,"But while the European leaders repeat lofty phrases about peace, democracy, and human rights, their actions tell a different story. Over the past two years, the EU has emerged not as a mediator but as a committed participant in the Ukraine conflict. And not through diplomacy, but through escalating military aid. Tanks, missiles, air defense systems, and billions of dollars in military funding continue to flow eastward, all under the guise of ‘’supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty/’’",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/
2301,"In reality, EU’s actions reveal a deliberate political and economic choice to prolong the Ukraine war, and not to end it. Instead of using its influence to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, the EU clearly has tied its future to a military resolution of the conflict. Each new arms package makes a diplomatic compromise less likely, and locks Ukraine into a cycle of dependency and continued devastation.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/
2302,"Peace plans proposed by neutral actors namely China, African leaders, and even the Vatican, have been dismissed or ignored outright by the EU. Any talk of ceasefire or negotiation is increasingly branded as ‘’pro – Russian,’’ even when it comes from voices with no ties to Russia. Behind the EU moral posturing lies a set of very real interests.Its defensesector , from Germany’s Rheinmetall to France’s Dassault, is enjoying a boom, as European governments race to rearm and expand their military budgets.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/

2304,"Yet the EU is currently in crisis,but its leaders want to ‘’fix it’’ through warfare. The union has been in the grips of multiple deepening crisis : a cost – of – living crisis, a housing crisis, a migration crisis, a sluggish growth crisis, the crisis of climate change, which continues to fuel deadly natural disasters,above all a political crisis.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/
2305,"The union faces a significant challenge from the far right, which is surging in the polls in many EU countries, threatening to upend the fragile EU cohesion and ‘’liberal values.’’ Unsurprisingly, the response of the EU political leadership to these mounting crises has been not to address their root causes, which boils down to the destructive neoliberal policies they have happily embraced. Instead, their reaction has been to war – monger, perhaps hoping that the prospect of war can help the people of Europe forget their grievances.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/
2306,"The EU leaders nurse the political fear of being perceived as weak, ‘’giving in to Putin,’’ through toeingPresident Trump’shardline stance on peace in Ukraine at all costs.Asaresult they haveeffectively shut down thespace for anypeace – oriented discourse. Over the past two years the EU has been telling the world that the biggest threat to European security is Russia and that the solution to it is to defeat Russia in Ukraine. Andrepeatedly telling the world that the path to peace is escalating.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/
2307,"Voices that call for de-escalation, restraint, or neutrality are quickly silencedor sidelined as naïve or disloyal. The tragedy is that it’s not just Ukraine that is paying the price for this war, but all of Europe is being dragged into a prolonged and dangerous confrontation. The risk of wider escalation is growing. The social and economic toll of the war is mounting. And still, the European establishment offers no vision of peace, only more weapons, more war, and more suffering.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/
2308,"Rather EU weapons have been flowing into Ukraine, with EU countries gradually expanding their range to include more deadly, more destructive weapons. The latest has been the insistence by European leaders, including the out-goingEU foreignChief, JosepBorrell, that Ukraine be allowed to use long range missiles to hit targets on Russian territory.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/
2309,"If Europe truly wants peace, it should act like it. But it has chosen to fuel the fire while insisting it’s helping to put it out.While escalation through weapons supplies to Ukraine continues, the war economic mantra has also been promoted, as Europeans are pushed to believe that military build-up can boost the flailing European economy.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/the-european-union-new-war-mongering/

The scheme, which brought together already existing occupational insurance schemes, has reached its 30th year and now covers 99.9 percent of the population. The NHI system provides equitable, accessible, and efficient healthcare to all people in Taiwan. It is also an important pillar and guarantor of Taiwan’s social stability as well as people’s health and safety. It has, moreover, become a global benchmark for achieving universal health coverage.

It is also overseeing development of infrastructure and applications to use health data to promote health and well-being. Taiwan continues to utilize its prowess in information and communications technology to build effective, high-ROI health systems and services. The NHI cloud facilitates the more efficient exchange of medical records, while the adoption of international standards such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources enhances international medical data sharing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan played a crucial role in sharing supplies, strategies, and experiences, and proved to be a reliable partner of countries worldwide.

However, Taiwan has been prevented from participating in WHO—the foremost global health cooperation body—due to China’s continued distortion of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and World Health Assembly Resolution 25.1.

It is imperative that WHO adopt a more open-minded approach and demonstrate flexibility, adhering to the principles of professionalism and inclusivity. Taiwan should be included, as a matter of pragmatism, in the World Health Assembly and all WHO meetings, activities, and mechanisms, particularly those concerned with the WHO pandemic agreement.

2357,ByJeff Ukachukwu.,Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2358,"Nigeria’spower sector has lurched from one crisis to another for more than three decades—chronic generation shortfalls, ageing transmission lines, opaque tariffs, and a regulatory environment many investors found impenetrable. Peak demand now regularly exceeds 19 GW, yet available capacity hovers around 4–5 GW, forcing households and businesses to rely on costly self-generation. Analysts have long argued that only a disruptive intervention, coupled with decentralised solutions, could lift the country out of this quagmire. That intervention arrived in March 2023, when the 9th National Assembly passed—and ex-President Muhammadu Buhari signed—a constitutional amendment that moved electricity from the Exclusive List to the Concurrent Legislative List.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2359,"For the first time, states were empowered to enact their own electricity laws, issue licences, and regulate intra-state markets. Enugu state governor, Mr Peter Mbah, looked at a new legal opportunity and didn’t file it away for some future administration to deal with. For Enugu, it was a lifeline, and Governor Peter Mbah grabbed it with both hands. How did a state that shared in Nigeria’s decades‑old power malaise flip the script so fast?",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2360,"Within three months of his tenure, Governor Mbah’s administration drafted and passed a law many believed would take years to materialise. The Enugu State Electricity Bill was swiftly signed into law on September 1, 2023, giving birth to the Enugu State Electricity Regulatory Commission—EERC. With this, the State assumed the authority to regulate electricity generation, transmission, and distribution within its boundaries. And in constituting the Commission, Governor Mbah headhunted even outside the state, for very experienced hands in the industry.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2361,"This, in a historic move, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) commenced the process of delegating full oversight to a subnational authority for the first time in the country’s history. setting the pace, Enugu officially started taking control of its electricity market on April 22, 2024. By October, the transition was complete. Enugu became the first Nigerian State to own its power destiny from plug to pole, a testament to the speed and efficiency of the State’s transformation.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2362,"This was no mere bureaucratic handover. It was the beginning of a redefinition of power in the most literal sense. The EERC swiftly issued interim distribution license, processed independent power generation applications, and resolved consumer complaints with a speed rarely seen in Nigeria’s public service. They licensed Mainpower Electricity Distribution Limited, a new vehicle created by the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC), to handle intra-state power delivery. Then came the generation licenses—10 megawatts for Fedikore Limited and another 5 megawatts for Tempo Power Solutions. Just like that, 15MW of embedded generation capacity was on the table, and several more applications are in the pipeline.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2363,"“This was never about symbolism,” said EERC Chair Chijioke Okonkwo. “Investors needed regulatory certainty, consumers needed speed, and the State needed power.” Chijioke likes to rattle off the scoreboard: two-generation licences, one interim distribution licence and “over 60 customer complaints resolved” in half a year. Tempo Power Solutions Executive Chairman Collins Kalabare is even more direct: “The process is seamless—you don’t need to know anybody.”",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2364,"However, policy and licensing are just the beginning of the change. The real transformation is in the people—the heart of the story. In Maryland, a mechanic like Obinna Obikwu no longer closes shop early due to power outages. “Honestly, outages are no longer like before now,” says Obikwu. “We suffered under EEDC, but since the new Commission took charge, the difference is being gradually felt. At least, they resolve your complaints.”His neighbour, Loveday Ikpeama, agrees—though he still pleads for prepaid meters so the billing can catch up with the service. Ikpeama was also elated that the days of bribery for connection were over. The EERC’s processes—licensing, tariffs, complaint resolution—are online, visible, and, most importantly, trusted.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2365,"In Coal Camp, Abakpa, Awkunanaw, hope is rising. In the nooks and crannies, power solutions are being created. The relief and joy felt by the residents of Enugu are palpable. But even more fundamental is the hope that wells up in them by that with the continued interest and influx by investors in the electricity sector, the challenges of power poverty that debilitated creativity and enterprise, will soon be a thing of the past.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2366,"Meanwhile, the reasons the Enugu State electricity market is attractive to investors were aptly captured by the Exective Director of Tempo Power, Mr Collins Kalabare, during the aforementioned issuance of 5MW power generation license to the company. He was full of praise for the EERC for running a professional, transparent, and independent system where investors do not need to know anybody to get things done fast.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2367,"“I must appreciate the EERC for the professional, business-minded and openness of their processes and operations. The process is seamless and you do not need to known anybody. EERC is indeed working according to the vision and speed of Gov Peter Mbah, who we have learnt is in a hurry to develop and make Enugu State economy grow and uplift the general status of residents and businesses,” he stated.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2368,"The state government isn’t leaving it all to regulation. It’s pairing reform with enablers: roads to industrial clusters are being paved and upgraded. Security patrols have been strengthened to protect infrastructure. The government is working to identify anchor loads—industrial or commercial users who can act as stable off-takers to make new-generation projects bankable. They’re even addressing issues like unfair billing, as seen in recent directives to Mainpower about capping advance connection charges and curbing arbitrary estimated billing.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2369,"Of course, challenges remain. Gas supply is not guaranteed, especially with FX volatility and pipeline vandalism, which are still an ever-present threat. Legacy debts from EEDC need to be cleaned up. And EERC, though nimble, is small—just 20 staff members managing an entire market. Plans are underway to scale that up, but the gap is real. Still, these are the problems of a market in motion, not one stuck in stasis.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2370,"The broader picture is stunning. Enugu isn’t just electrifying its communities—it’s lighting up a path for others. Lagos, Edo, and Kaduna are watching. The federal government is watching. Investors, who once wouldn’t touch Nigeria’s power sector with a ten-foot pole, are now flying into Akanu Ibiam International Airport with feasibility studies in their backpacks. Enugu’s success is not just a local triumph but a beacon of hope for the entire nation, showing that the energy sector can be transformed with the right policies and determination. This potential for Enugu’s model to be replicated in other states should make the citizens feel hopeful for the future of Nigeria’s energy sector.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2371,"This is more than policy. It’s a culture shift. For a generation raised to treat “light” as a luxury, there’s something poetic about being able to charge your phone without stress, store food without fear of spoilage, and sleep without the throb of an old diesel generator in your ear.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/
2372,"And that’s perhaps the most important thing: hope is returning—slowly, cautiously, but tangibly. People are beginning to believe not just that the government can change things—but that it already has. For the first time in a long time, the average Enugu resident isn’t talking about what’s broken.

2373,"That shift in conversation—from despair to demand, from helplessness to expectation—is the truest sign that the power sector in Enugu isn’t just changing voltage levels. It’s changing lives. And maybe, just maybe, it’s changing the story of Nigeria itself. The transformation happening in Enugu State is not just infrastructural—it’s emotional, cultural, and even psychological. It’s the kind of change you don’t see in policies or project milestones but in how people carry themselves after dusk, in the conversations overheard in neighbourhood kiosks, and in how businesses now open with expectation and hope rather than anxiety. It’s in the growing silence—the beautiful silence—where the rattle of generators are now giving way.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/how-enugu-is-transforming-the-electricity-market/

Improved health results in greater well-being for the people and has ramifications for the survival and development of a country and even the world. At the 77th World Health Assembly, members adopted the World Health Organization (WHO) Fourteenth General Programme of Work for 2025-2028. The program includes such strategic objectives as improving health service coverage and bolstering financial protections to ensure universal health coverage. WHO has called on all countries to take action on these issues.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/advancing-health-equity-promoting-healthier-taiwan/
2380,"As concerns universal health coverage, Taiwan launched the National Health Insurance (NHI) system in 1995. The scheme, which brought together already existing occupational insurance schemes, has reached its 30th year and now covers 99.9 percent of the population. The NHI system provides equitable, accessible, and efficient healthcare to all people in Taiwan. It is also an important pillar and guarantor of Taiwan’s social stability as well as people’s health and safety. It has, moreover, become a global benchmark for achieving universal health coverage. In an annual survey carried out by Numbeo, Taiwan has been ranked first in the Health Care Index category for seven consecutive years.",Opinion,https://thesun.ng/advancing-health-equity-promoting-healthier-taiwan/
2381,"The NHI operates on a pay-as-you-go, self-sustaining model capable of addressing the financial challenges posed by an aging population and rising healthcare costs.

This aims to ensure that people are healthy, the nation is strong, and the world is more ready to embrace Taiwan. Remaining focused on people, families, and communities, we are expanding health promotion operations and preventive healthcare. Moreover, we are implementing a family physician plan, offering comprehensive care to patients with chronic diseases, and utilizing telemedicine to improve healthcare accessibility in rural areas.

It is also overseeing development of infrastructure and applications to use health data to promote health and well-being. Taiwan continues to utilize its prowess in information and communications technology to build effective, high-ROI health systems and services. The NHI cloud facilitates the more efficient exchange of medical records, while the adoption of international standards such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources enhances international medical data sharing. Additionally, the incorporation of AI-assisted technologies is advancing the development of smart healthcare.

2386,"In this rapidly changing era, health challenges transcend borders, and global cooperation has become essential to addressing various health crises. However, Taiwan has been prevented from participating in WHO—the foremost global health cooperation body—due to China’s continued distortion of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and World Health Assembly Resolution 25.1.

It is imperative that WHO adopt a more open-minded approach and demonstrate flexibility, adhering to the principles of professionalism and inclusivity. Taiwan should be included, as a matter of pragmatism, in the World Health Assembly and all WHO meetings, activities, and mechanisms, particularly those concerned with the WHO pandemic agreement.

So I sat down and asked myself, what do you really want? And I realized I was spending so much time on something that was supposed to be, I would say, a pathway to another place. So, I had to say, okay, what’s holding me now? And I went back and I realized I needed to be ready to be this thing that’s on my hand, to be a director.

It is an unfortunate situation those Nigerian actors who have worked for years but cannot afford their medical bills when they fall ill. Our members will no longer resort to public begging for their health or medical needs. Each and every actor or actress in Nigeria henceforth will enjoy a comprehensive health care.

I started with Fatai Alabi popularly known as Adekanbi presently based in London, Apostle Biodun Majekodunmi, popularly known as Baba Kekere. He is in the U.S now and late Mustapha Majelu. We were all friends, we gathered ourselves together to start theatre. People like Ade Love, who happens to be my mentor, each time I watch him on screen, he always motivates me. Fatai Alabi also shared his intentions, same applies to Abiodun and that was how we decided to form a theatre group in 1977. At No. 63 Moshalashi Street Obalende, for one year, we didn’t have any leader, we just started the group, later we were introduced to late Taiwo Olayinka popularly known as Agbodorogun. We were told that he had acted before under Sir James, who was a floor Manager in NTA 10. So, we were advised to call him to come and lead us, and he agreed to be our leader and he changed the name of the group to Isale Oro Theatre Group. He trained us for two years; he taught us how to compose songs, drama and every other thing and stage performance. In December 1980, he left us, and decided to form his own personal group and that was how we started our journey.",Entertainment,https://thesun.ng/why-i-dont-reject-roles-yinka-quadri/

When he left, we didn’t have any choice than to charge our name again, and that was how we changed to Adetutu Theatre Organisation. And Fatai Alabi led us for the first three years, 1981 to 1984, at the next election, I became the leader of that group.",Entertainment,https://thesun.ng/why-i-dont-reject-roles-yinka-quadri/

And the issue of being called a chairman, I don’t really know how it came about probably because I was the one that brought everybody together, that was why they decided to start calling me chairman. It was even Ogogo that started calling me chairman before any other person and that was how some other persons started calling me chairman. I have been an active member of our association since my foray into acting. In 1988, a group known as Positive Thinkers was formed. The likes of Dele Odule, Prince Jide Kosoko, and Rasak Adewale Sokoti are members. I was an active member and the group was created as a disciplinary forum for thespians.
